    <p align="justify">
      This page provides documentation and additional files to download
      for use with the LAMMPS Shell. The downloads are especially aimed
      at users that have
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/lammps/9pgqct71smdw"
         target="_blank">
         installed LAMMPS on Windows 10 through
         Microsoft Store</a>, since those are lacking those files.
      The alternative would be to download <a href="windows.html">
        "complete" installer packages</a>, however those are not
      cryptographically signed.  Those packages the only option when
      you want to use an MPI parallel version.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p align="justify">The LAMMPS Shell, <code>lammps-shell</code> is a
      program that functions very similar to the regular LAMMPS executable but
      has several modifications and additions that make it more powerful for
      interactive sessions, i.e. where you type LAMMPS commands from the
      prompt instead of reading them from a file.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It uses the readline and history libraries to provide command line
        editing and context aware TAB-expansion (details on that below).</li>
      <li>When processing an input file with the "-in" or "-i" flag from the
        command line, it behaves similar to the Python interpreter, i.e. it
        does not exit at the end of that input file but rather stops at a
        prompt, so that additional commands can be issued interactively.</li>
      <li>Errors will not abort the shell but return to the prompt.</li>
      <li>It has additional commands aimed at interactive use (details
      below).</li>
      <li>Interrupting a calculation with CTRL-C will not terminate the
        session but rather enforce a timer timeout to cleanly stop an
        ongoing run (more info on timeouts is in the documentation for
        the <code>timer</code> command documentation).</li>
    </ul>

    <p align="justify">These enhancements makes the LAMMPS shell an
      attractive choice for interactive LAMMPS sessions in graphical
      desktop environments (e.g. Gnome, KDE, Cinnamon, XFCE,
      Windows).</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>TAB-expansion</h2>
    <p align="justify">When writing commands interactively at the shell
      prompt, you can hit the TAB key at any time to try and complete the
      text.  This completion is context aware and will expand any first word
      only to commands available in that executable.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For style commands it will expand to available styles of the
        corresponding category (e.g. pair styles after a
        <code>pair_style</code> command).</li>
      <li>For <code>compute</code>, <code>fix</code>, or <code>dump</code>
        commands it will also expand only to already defined groups for
        the "group-ID" keyword.</li>
      <li>For commands like <code>compute_modify</code>,
        <code>fix_modify</code>, or <code>dump_modify</code> it will expand
        to known compute/fix/dump IDs only.</li>
      <li>When typing references to computes, fixes, or variables with a
        "c_", "f_", or "v_" prefix, respectively, then the expansion will
        be to known compute/fix IDs and variable names. Variable name
        expansion is also available for the ${name} variable syntax.</li>
      <li>In all other cases TAB expansion will complete to names of files
        and directories.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>Command line editing and history</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      When typing commands, command line editing similar to what BASH
      provides is available.  Thus it is possible to move around the
      currently line and perform various cut and insert and edit operations.
      Previous commands can be retrieved by scrolling up (and down)
      or searching (e.g. with CTRL-r).</p>
    <p align="justify">Also history expansion through using the exclamation mark "!"
      can be performed.  Examples: "!!" will be replaced with the previous
      command, "!-2" will repeat the command before that, "!30" will be
      replaced with event number 30 in the command history list, and
      "!run" with the last command line that started with <code>run</code>.  Adding
      a ":p" to such a history expansion will result that the expansion is
      printed and added to the history list, but NOT executed.
      On exit the LAMMPS shell will write the history list to a file
      <code>.lammps_history</code> in the current working directory.  If such a
      file exists when the LAMMPS shell is launched it will be read to
      populate the history list.</p>
    <p align="justify">
      This is realized via the readline library and can thus be customized
      with an <code>.inputrc</code> file in the home directory.  For application
      specific customization, the LAMMPS shell uses the name "lammps-shell".
      For more information about using and customizing an application using
      readline, please see the available documentation at:
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/readline/#Documentation" target="_blank">https://www.gnu.org/s/readline/#Documentation</a></p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Additional commands</h2>
    <p align="justify">The following commands are added to the LAMMPS shell
      on top of the regular LAMMPS commands:</p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
help (or ?)    print a brief help message
history        display the current command history list
clear_history  wipe out the current command history list
save_history &lt;range&gt; &lt;file&gt;
               write commands from the history to file.
               The range is given as &lt;from&gt;-&lt;to&gt;, where &lt;from&gt; and &lt;to&gt;
               may be empty. Example: save_history 100- in.recent
source &lt;file&gt;  read commands from file (same as &quot;include&quot;)
pwd            print current working directory
cd &lt;directory&gt; change current working directory (same as pwd if no directory)
mem            print current and maximum memory usage
|&lt;command&gt;     execute &lt;command&gt; as a shell command and return to the command prompt
exit           exit the LAMMPS shell cleanly (unlike the &quot;quit&quot; command)</pre>

    <p>Please note that some known shell operations are implemented in the LAMMPS
      <code>shell</code> command in a platform neutral fashion, while using the "|"
      character will always pass the following text to the operating system's shell
      command.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Readline customization</h2>
    <p align="justify">The behavior of the readline functionality can be customized in the
      <code>${HOME}/.inputrc</code> file.  This can be used to alter the default
      settings or change the key-bindings.  The LAMMPS Shell sets the
      application name <code>lammps-shell</code>, so settings can be either applied
      globally or only for the LAMMPS shell by bracketing them between
      <pre>
$if lammps-shell
# disable "beep" or "screen flash"
set bell-style none
# bind the "Insert" key to toggle overwrite mode
"\e[2~": overwrite-mode
$endif
</pre>
    <p>More details about this are in the <a href="https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rluserman.html#SEC9" target="_blank">readline documentation</a>.

    <h2>LAMMPS Shell tips and tricks</h2>
    <h3>Enable tilde expansion</h3>
<p>Adding <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span> <span class="pre">expand-tilde</span> <span class="pre">on</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${HOME}/.inputrc</span></code> is recommended as
this will change the filename expansion behavior to replace any text
starting with "~" by the full path to the corresponding user's home
directory.  While the expansion of filenames <strong>will</strong> happen on all
arguments where the context is not known (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/compile/lamm&lt;TAB&gt;</span></code>
will expand to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/compile/lammps/</span></code>), it will not replace the tilde by
default.  But since LAMMPS does not do tilde expansion itself (unlike a
shell), this will result in errors.  Instead the tilde-expression should
be expanded into a valid path, where the plain "~/" stands for the
current user's home directory and "~someuser/" stands for
"/home/someuser" or whatever the full path to that user's home directory
is.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-extension-association">
<h3>File extension association</h3>
<p>Since the LAMMPS shell (unlike the regular LAMMPS executable) does not
exit when an input file is passed on the command line with the "-in" or
"-i" flag (the behavior is like for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">-i</span> <span class="pre">&lt;filename&gt;</span></code>), it makes
the LAMMPS shell suitable for associating it with input files based on
their filename extension (e.g. ".lmp").  Since <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lammps-shell</span></code> is a
console application, you have to run it inside a terminal program with a
command line like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>xterm -title <span class="s2">&quot;LAMMPS Shell&quot;</span> -e /path/to/lammps-shell -i in.file.lmp
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-history-create-input-file">
<h3>Use history create input file</h3>
<p>When experimenting with commands to interactively to figure out a
suitable choice of settings or simply the correct syntax, you may want
to record part of your commands to a file for later use.  This can be
done with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_history</span></code> commands, which allows to selectively
write a section of the command history to a file (Example:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">save_history</span> <span class="pre">25-30</span> <span class="pre">in.run</span></code>).  This file can be further edited
(Example: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">|vim</span> <span class="pre">in.run</span></code>) and then the file read back in and tried out
(Example: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">source</span> <span class="pre">in.run</span></code>).  If the input also creates a system box,
you first need to use the <code>clear</code> command command.</p>
