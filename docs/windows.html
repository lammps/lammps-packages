    <h1>LAMMPS Windows Installer Repository</h1>
    <p align="justify">
      This repository is hosting pre-compiled Windows installers of the
      <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/" target="_blank">LAMMPS</a>
      molecular dynamics simulation software package.
      The binaries are built with MinGW64 Linux to Windows
      cross compilers on Fedora Linux using the standard LAMMPS sources.

      The LAMMPS binaries contain <b>all</b> optional packages included in
      the source distribution <b>except</b>:
      <ul>
        <li><u>KIM</u> (not fully ported to Windows),
        <li><u>KOKKOS</u> (does not fully support cross-compilation with GCC),
        <li><u>MSCG</u> (requires an external library),
        <li><u>PYTHON</u> (requires to bundle a full Python runtime),
        <li><u>USER-ADIOS</u> (requires an external library),
        <li><u>USER-H5MD</u> (requires an external library),
        <li><u>USER-MDI</u> (requires an external library),
        <li><u>USER-NETCDF</u> (requires an external library),
        <li><u>USER-PACE</u> (requires an external library),
        <li><u>USER-QMMM</u> (only useful when linking to a QM software),
        <li><u>USER-QUIP</u> (requires an external library),
        <li><u>USER-VTK</u> (requires an external library).
      </ul>
      The <b>lmp_serial</b> executable additionally does not contain the
      <u>MPIIO</u> and <u>USER-LB</u> packages, since those require
      <i>MPI-IO</i> functions, which are not available without linking
      to a real MPI library instead of the MPI STUBS for serial execution.

    <h3>Some Notes on GPU Support</h3>
    <div align="justify">
      These Windows binaries include GPU acceleration via the <u>GPU</u> package.
      This is achieved through compiling the GPU package in OpenCL mode and linking
      to an <a href="http://www.khronos.org/opencl/" target="_blank">OpenCL</a>
      compatible ICD loader.  The included OpenCL loader library is compatible
      with OpenCL version 1.2 to 2.1. This means the executables do not contain
      any vendor provided code and should be compatible with current GPUs from
      <a href="http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/"
      target="_blank">AMD</a>,
      <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/opencl-drivers.html"
      target="_blank">Intel</a>, and <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/opencl/" target="_blank">Nvidia</a>.
      The GPU package has been compiled for mixed precision computation and
      as of LAMMPS version 10 March 2021 will automatically tune itself for
      the OpenCL capable hardware in use.
      <br>
    </div>
    <div align="justify">
      In the case of having multiple Vendor provided OpenCL runtimes
      installed, you may run into the situation of the "wrong" runtime
      being set as the default and used by LAMMPS. In this case, you may
      need to remove unwanted vendors from the windows registry database. Look for the
      key: <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors</code>,
      and remove vendors with non-functional OpenCL support.
      When reporting problems, please always include the exact
      <u>version of the installer</u> and the output of the
      <strong><code>ocl_get_devices</code></strong> tool.

    <h3>LAMMPS Python module</h3>
    <div align="justify">
      These Windows binaries are built with a shared library
      (liblammps.dll) and include the LAMMPS Python wrapper module
      (lammps.py) which is placed in a directory included in
      the <b>PYTHONPATH</b> environment variable.  That makes it
      possible to import it into a suitable Python interpreter on
      Windows without any additional setup. This has been tested with
      the Python interpreters bundled with <i>Microsoft Visual
      Studio</i>, but should be usable with any Python interpreter that
      is for the same architecture (32-bit or 64-bit x86).<br>
    </div>
    <div style="clear:both;"></div>
    <hr width="100%">
    <h3>LAMMPS Shell</h3>
    <div align="justify">
      These Windows packages also include the
      <a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Tools.html#lammps-shell">LAMMPS Shell</a/>,
      a customized LAMMPS executable enhanced for interactive use.

    <h2>Installing LAMMPS on Windows</h2>
    <div style="display: inline; margin-left: 10px; border: 5px; border-style: groove; float: right;">
      <img src="win-installer-screenshot.png" border="0" style="" width="246" height="191">
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #e8e8f0;">
      <div align="justify">
        There are installer packages for 32-bit and 64-bit
        versions of Windows available.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://rpm.lammps.org/windows/">Latest stable versions</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://rpm.lammps.org/windows/32bit/">32-bit Windows download area</a> with all available installer versions</li>
          <li><a href="http://rpm.lammps.org/windows/64bit/">64-bit Windows download area</a> with all available installer versions</li>
        </ul>
        The respective download directory will contain installer
        packages that are labeled with the date of the LAMMPS version
        and packages labeled as <i>latest</i>.  It is usually
        recommended to download and install the latest package.
        The other packages are provided in case there is a problem with it.
        Download the installer executable suitable for your machine,
        execute it, and follow the instructions in the dialogs.
        Each version will install into a different directory, so it
        is possible to have multiple versions installed at the same
        time (however it is not recommended). Both kinds of packages contain:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Either:</u> a regular multi-threaded LAMMPS executable called <strong><code>lmp_serial</code></strong>.
          This should <u>always</u> work.</li>

        <li><u>Or:</u> a multi-threaded LAMMPS executable that also supports
          parallel execution via MPI message passing. This
          executable is called  <strong><code>lmp_mpi</code></strong>
          and requires installation of a suitable MPICH2 package to work.</li>

        <li>the <a href="http://colvars.github.io/" target="_blank">colvars</a>
          reference manual in PDF format</li>
        <li>several additional PDF format guides for specific packages or styles</li>

      </ul>

      <p align="justify">Both executables will run in serial when executed directly.
        Please see below for instructions on how to perform parallel runs.
        To use the MPI based parallelism, you also need to install
          <a href="http://www.mpich.org/" target="_blank">MPICH2 from Argonne lab</a>.
        For 32-bit Windows you have to download and install
          <a href="http://www.mpich.org/static/tarballs/1.4.1p1/mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-ia32.msi">
            mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-ia32.msi</a>. This is the latest available binary 32-bit
          MPI package compatible with the GNU cross compilers used to compile LAMMPS.
        Correspondingly, for 64-bit Windows you have to download and install
          <a href="http://www.mpich.org/static/tarballs/1.4.1p1/mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-x86-64.msi">
            mpich2-1.4.1p1-win-x86-64.msi</a>. This is the latest available binary 64-bit
          MPI package compatible with the GNU cross compilers used to compile LAMMPS.

    <h2>Installing LAMMPS globally on Windows with administrator privilege</h2>
    <div align="justify">
      The installer packages listed above will install LAMMPS into a user's
      personal storage area and thus it cannot be used by all users. This behavior
      was changed with the stable release of LAMMPS in October 2020.
      Installer packages from previous LAMMPS versions and current versions that
      require administrator privilege to be installed can be found
      <a href="http://rpm.lammps.org/windows/admin/">their own download area</a>.
      The content is otherwise the same, only the packaging is different.

    <h2>Running LAMMPS on Windows</h2>
    <h3>General Comments</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      LAMMPS is a text mode program, so you have to click on the
      <i>Command Prompt</i> entry in the windows start menu, launch the
      <i>Windows Power Shell</i>, or simply execute the command
      <strong><code>cmd</code></strong> from <i>Start -&gt; Run</i>.
      The LAMMPS manual and the colvars reference manual in PDF format
      are linked from the start men, also references to open the
      file system browser to view the <i>Benchmarks</i> and <i>Examples</i>
      directory tree. The <b>PATH</b> environment variable is automatically
      set by the installer, so that the bundled executables from everywhere
      in the system. Also the <b>LAMMPS_POTENTIALS</b> environment variable
      is preset to the folder with the bundled manybody potential files,
      so they do not need to be copied into the respective working directory.
    </p>

    <h3>Serial Execution</h3>
    <div style="display: inline; margin-left: 10px; border: 5px; border-style: groove; float: right;">
      <a imageanchor="1" href="lammps-icms-on-win7.png" style=""><img src="lammps-icms-on-win7.png" border="0" style="" width="400" height="300"></a>
    </div>
    <p align="justify">
      To run a LAMMPS simulations open a terminal window as outlined above
      and change to the directory with your input script and then run either
      <strong><code>lmp_serial</code></strong> or <strong><code>lmp_mpi</code></strong>
      As described in the LAMMPS manual. For more details and additional command
      line flags, please check out the
      <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_start.html#start_6" target="_blank">
        LAMMPS Manual</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 name="openmp">Multi-threaded Parallel Execution</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      All LAMMPS binaries from this repository support multi-threading via OpenMP,
      however by default only one thread is enabled. To enable more threads, e.g. four,
      you need to either set it at the command line prompt via
      <strong><code>set OMP_NUM_THREADS=4</code></strong>, via the
      <strong><code>-pk&nbsp;omp&nbsp;4</code></strong> command line flag, or via the
      <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/package.html" target="_blank">package omp 4</a>
      command in your input script.</p>

    <p align="justify">
      After enabling the use of multiple threads, you <b>also</b> have to select
      styles in LAMMPS, that are multi-thread enabled. Those are usually identified
      by the <i>/omp</i> suffix. Those can be selected explicitly and selectively,
      or with the
      <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/package.html" target="_blank">suffix</a>
      command or - most conveniently - via using the <strong><code>-sf&nbsp;omp</code></strong>
      command line flag to the LAMMPS executable.
    </p>
    Example: <strong><code>lmp_serial -pk omp 4 -sf omp -in in.melt</code></strong>

    <h3 name="mpi">Message Passing (MPI) Parallel Execution</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      Only the <strong><code>lmp_mpi</code></strong> executable supports parallel execution
      via MPI (which can be combined with OpenMPI multi-threading). For that you also
      need to install a specific version of MPICH2 from Argonne lab linked above.
      The installer does not contain it and does not check for it. Please note, that
      you need to download a very specific (and rather old) version of the MPICH
      package, as this is what LAMMPS was compiled with and the latest available
      Windows binary version compatible with the GNU compilers used to compile LAMMPS.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      After the installation of the MPICH software, it needs to be integrated into the system.
      For this you need to start a <i>Command Prompt</i> in <i>Administrator Mode</i> (right
      click on the icon and select it). Change into the MPICH2 installation directory, then
      into the subdirectory <code>bin</code> and execute
      <strong><code>smpd.exe -install</code></strong>.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      MPI parallel executables have to be launched with <strong><code>mpiexec -localonly # lmp_mpi ...</code></strong>
      or <strong><code>mpiexec -np # lmp_mpi ...</code></strong> with "#" being then number
      of parallel processes to start. For the latter you may be asked for your password.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">

      <u><i>Known Issues:</i></u> while running in MPI parallel mode any
      output to the screen is block buffered and not line buffered as
      usual. That is, output will not show up immediately, but only
      after a certain amount of output has accumulated. This is done for
      efficiency reasons.  Multi-threaded parallel or serial runs are
      not affected.  Also when running under mpiexec, you should not use
      multi-threading since MPICH restricts processes to a single
      physical CPU thus it will run less efficient. </p>
