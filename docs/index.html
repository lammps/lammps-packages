    <h1>Building and Installing LAMMPS Precompiled Packages for Windows</h1>
    <p align="justify">
      The LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation package is commonly
      installed, customized, and compiled by its users from source code,
      which can be obtained from its
      <a href="https://www.lammps.org" target="_blank">home page</a>
      as tar archives or from its
      <a href="https://gihub.com/lammps/lammps/" target="_blank">GitHub
        project page</a> as snapshot zip archive or git repository clone.
    <p align="justify">
      However, few people using Windows are familiar compiling
      applications from source code and have the necessary tools
      installed. Furthermore Windows applications are usually bundled
      with an installer/uninstaller tool to manage the deployment of the
      precompiled binaries and associated files or can be installed from
      the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/windows" target="_blank">
        Microsoft Store</a>.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      For quick testing and simple calculations, there is is a package with
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/lammps/9pgqct71smdw" target="_blank">
        a LAMMPS executable and the LAMMPS shell available through the
      Microsoft Store</a>.  This only consists of a serial executable
      with OpenMP and OpenCL support, is set up for use with Windows 10
      and does not contain examples, documentation, or potential files.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">The purpose of this webpage is to provide access
      to fully featured LAMMPS packages for Windows that have been built
      by the LAMMPS developers and contain as complete a set of features
      as technically meaningful (not all code is ported to Windows) and
      legally possible with the restrictions on some of the licenses for
      add-on libraries.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">The second part of this webpage documents the custom
      tools and scripts used in the process of building these packages,
      so that interested people can go about and customize it or contribute
      solutions to known problems or suggest improved, alternate approaches
      for the procedures used.

    <h2>Online Help for the LAMMPS Shell App</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      <a href="lammps-shell.html">This page</a> provides documentation
      and additional files to download for use with the LAMMPS
      Shell. The downloads are especially aimed at users that have
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/lammps/9pgqct71smdw"
         target="_blank">
         installed LAMMPS on Windows 10 through the Microsoft Store</a>,
      since those are lacking those files.

    <h2>Downloading, Installing, and Using Pre-compiled LAMMPS Packages</h2>
    <h3><a href="windows.html">Installer packages for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows</a></h3>
    <p align="justify">These packages are executables containing
      a <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/" target="_blank"> Nullsoft
      scriptable installer</a> for Windows versions from Windows XP
      (SP2) to Windows 10 (theoretically, due to limited time and access
      currently only Windows 10 is tested). The packages are available
      for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems, with and without support
      for MPI (a link for a compatible MPI library installer is
      provided) and with and without support for the PYTHON package
      (NOTE: the Python <b>module</b>, i.e. the option to import LAMMPS
      into Python scripts is <b>always</b> included).  These packages
      also contain several PDF format files with the LAMMPS manual and
      associated documentation, most of the example inputs, bundled
      potential files, benchmark input and some tools.
