# lammps

LAMMPS has potentials for soft materials (biomolecules, polymers) and
solid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) and coarse-grained or
mesoscopic systems. It can be used to model atoms or, more generically, as a
parallel particle simulator at the atomic, meso, or continuum scale.

LAMMPS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing
techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain. The code is
designed to be easy to modify or extend with new functionality.
