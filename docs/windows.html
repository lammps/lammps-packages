    <h1>LAMMPS Windows Installer Repository</h1>
    <p align="justify">
      This repository is hosting pre-compiled Windows installers of the
      <a href="https://lammps.org/" target="_blank">LAMMPS</a>
      molecular dynamics simulation software package.
      The binaries are built with MinGW64 Linux to Windows
      cross-compilers on Fedora Linux using the standard LAMMPS sources.

      The LAMMPS binaries contain <b>all</b> optional packages included in
      the source distribution <b>except</b>:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-adios" target="_blank">ADIOS</a> (requires an external library),
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-h5md" target="_blank">H5MD</a> (requires an external library),
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-intel" target="_blank">INTEL</a> (requires Intel compiler for better performance than OPENMP),
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-kim" target="_blank">KIM</a> (not yet fully ported to Windows cross-compilation),
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-ml-pace" target="_blank">ML-PACE</a> (available as plugin),
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-plumed" target="_blank">PLUMED</a> (available as plugin),
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-ml-quip" target="_blank">ML-QUIP</a> (not fully ported to Windows),
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-netcdf" target="_blank">NETCDF</a> (requires an external library),
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-qmmm" target="_blank">QMMM</a> (only useful when linking to a QM software),
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-rheo" target="_blank">RHEO</a> (requires an external library)
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-scafacos" target="_blank">SCAFACOS</a> (requires an external library).
        <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-vtk" target="_blank">VTK</a> (requires an external library).
      </ul>
      <div>The <b>serial</b> executable additionally does <b>not</b> contain the
        <a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-latboltz" target="_blank">LATBOLTZ</a>
        package, since it requires <i>MPI-IO</i> functions, which are not available without linking
        to a real MPI library.</div>
      <div>
        <br>
        Starting with the 17 February 2022 version of LAMMPS the KOKKOS
        package with the serial and OpenMP backends enabled is
        included. GPU support for Kokkos is currently not possible for
        these packages due to compiling the binaries with a cross-compiler.
      </div>
      <div>
        <br>
        Starting with the 24 March 2022 version of LAMMPS the PLUGIN
        package is included.
      </div>
      <div>
        <br>
        Starting with the 7 February 2024 version of LAMMPS the INTEL
        package is no longer included.  The performance benefit for the
        package are small since the installer is not built with the
        Intel compilers.
      </div>
      <div>
        <br>
        Starting with the 17 April 2024 version of LAMMPS the USER-REBOMOS
        plugin installer is no longer created.  The corresponding pair style
        has been improved, documented, and added to the MANYBODY package of
        the regular LAMMPS distribution.

      <h3>Plugin Packages for Additional LAMMPS Packages</h3>
      <div align="justify">
        As of LAMMPS version 23 June 2022, we have started to provide
        add-on installer packages that contain LAMMPS packages as
        plugins.  Those are separate packages because either their
        source code is not part of the LAMMPS distribution or uses and
        external library with licensing terms that prohibits linking the
        package into the LAMMPS executable and library directly.  There
        are two variants of the plugin packages: one with support for
        MPI and one without.  The corresponding LAMMPS installer
        packages have the PLUGIN package included and are set up to
        automatically load such plugins immediately at runtime as shown
        in the picture to the right.
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        The following packages are currently available as plugin installer packages:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-ml-pace" target="_blank">ML-PACE</a>
          <li><a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-plumed" target="_blank">PLUMED</a> (since 27 June 2024)
          <li><a href="https://github.com/psaidi/AEAM" target="_blank">USER-AEAM</a>
          <li><a href="https://matsci.org/t/discrepency-beween-old-version-and-new-version/50014/5" target="_blank">USER-BFIELD</a>
          <li><a href="https://sites.psu.edu/sinnott/software/" target="_blank">USER-REBOMOS</a> (only for LAMMPS versions before 17 April 2024)
        </ul>

        The <a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Python_module.html"
               target="_blank"> LAMMPS Python module</a> (to call LAMMPS from
        Python) is included in <b>all</b> packages in a way, that it
        should work with a suitable Python installation of your own,
        since a LAMMPS shared library (i.e. a DLL file on Windows) is
        included.
        The <a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Packages_details.html#pkg-python"
               target="_blank">PYTHON</a> package (to call Python from LAMMPS)
        however, is only included in the installer package with Python
        in the name.  Those packages also include a full Python runtime
        environment with all standard Python modules and the NumPy
        module since those have to be consistent with the Python library
        used to compile LAMMPS.  Please note that the 64-bit Windows
        NumPy module is considered <b>very experimental</b> and thus one
        should expect crashes that are not bugs in LAMMPS.
      </div>

    <hr width="100%">
    <h3>Important Note on Microsoft Defender and Other Virus Scanners Reporting Trojans or Viruses</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      Sometimes virus scanners will report that the LAMMPS installer packages
      <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/NSIS_False_Positives" target="_blank">contain a Trojan or Virus</a>.
      If you downloaded the installer from this website and get a match for the SHA-256 checksums, then
      the report is most likely a false positive.  This can happen with installer packages like the ones
      provided here, since they are applications with interpreted byte code that triggers the false positive.
      The installer packages are created with a cross-compiler on a protected Linux machine using authenticated
      development tools, so it is close to impossible to produce infected packages.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">If you come across such a case, please
      <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/NSIS_False_Positives#Where_to_report_false_positives" target="_blank">report
        the false positive to the antivirus vendor</a>.  You can usually then tell the virus scanner software to
      ignore the virus report and execute or restore the installer package anyway and install LAMMPS.  However,
      we only recommend to do this, if you downloaded the package from the <code>lammps.org</code> domain and have
      verified the checksum to make certain you have an unmodified file.  We cannot prevent malicious people from
      building LAMMPS installer packages that *do* contain malware, however unlikely it may seem.
    </p>

    <hr width="100%">
    <h3>Important Notes on Changes to the Installer Packages</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      Starting with the 2 August 2023 stable release, we have reduced
      the number of compiled variants.  All packages install at user
      level. Microsoft MPI (MS-MPI) is the only supported MPI library.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      As of LAMMPS version 17 February 2022, only 64-bit versions of the LAMMPS
      installer packages will be built and provided. If you must have a 32-bit
      version, you need to use an older version of LAMMPS or compile LAMMPS from
      source.  Compiling LAMMPS on Windows with Visual Studio 2022
      (<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/" target="_blank">available
        cost-free as Community Edition</a>) is now fully supported.
    </p>
    <div align="justify">
      As of LAMMPS version 27 May 2021, the LAMMPS installer packages will detect
      if LAMMPS (version 27 May 2021 or later) has already been installed and will
      offer to uninstall, in case it is.  This should be independent from whether
      it was 32-bit or 64-bit version and with or without MPI or Python.  Having
      multiple versions/variants of LAMMPS installed at the same time is no longer
      supported. Also, the name of the LAMMPS executable has been simplified to
      <u>lmp.exe</u> in all packages since there is no longer a need to
      differentiate between the MPI and non-MPI version.

    <h3>Some Notes on GPU Support</h3>
    <div align="justify">
      <div style="display: inline; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; border: 5px; float: left;">
        <img src="opencl_logo_75_75.png" border="0" style="" width="75" height="75">
      </div>
      These Windows binaries include GPU acceleration via the <u>GPU</u> package.
      This is achieved through compiling the GPU package in OpenCL mode and linking
      to an <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/" target="_blank">OpenCL</a>
      compatible ICD loader.  The included OpenCL loader library is compatible
      with OpenCL version 1.2 to 3.0.  This means the executables do not contain
      any vendor provided code and should be compatible with current GPUs from
      <a href="https://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/" target="_blank">AMD</a>,
      <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/opencl-drivers.html" target="_blank">Intel</a>,
      and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/opencl/" target="_blank">Nvidia</a>.
      You need to have an HD or UHD GPU in an 8th generation or later core
      architecture Intel CPU for Intel GPU OpenCL support.  Intel Xe type
      GPUs are not supported since they support single precision only.
      The GPU package has been compiled for mixed precision computation and
      as of LAMMPS version 10 March 2021 will automatically tune itself for
      the OpenCL capable hardware in use.
      <br>
    </div>
    <div align="justify">
      In the case of having multiple Vendor provided OpenCL runtimes
      installed, you may run into the situation of the "wrong" runtime
      being set as the default and used by LAMMPS. In this case, you may
      need to remove unwanted vendors from the windows registry database. Look for the
      key: <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenCL\Vendors</code>,
      and remove vendors with non-functional OpenCL support.
      When reporting problems, please always include the exact
      <u>version of the installer</u> and the output of the
      <strong><code>ocl_get_devices</code></strong> tool.

      These Windows binaries are built to include a shared library
      (liblammps.dll) and and also contain the LAMMPS Python wrapper
      module which is placed in a directory included in
      the <b>PYTHONPATH</b> environment variable.  That makes it
      possible to import it into a suitable Python interpreter on
      Windows without any additional setup.  This has been tested with
      the Python interpreters bundled with <i>Microsoft Visual Studio</i>
      and those downloaded from <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">
        python.org </a> but should be usable with any Python interpreter that
      is for the same architecture (32-bit or 64-bit x86).</div><br>
    <div align="justify">
      This module with the <i>Python interface to LAMMPS</i> is <u>always</u> included
      and the packages with a Python runtime include may import the LAMMPS python module
      from within their Python functions or classes.  However, the LAMMPS installer packages
      do not include a Python executable for standalone use.

      output from the simulation is captured and shown in a separate log window.
      After a run, it is also possible to create a snapshot image representing
      the current state of the simulation.

      and packages labeled as <i>latest</i> or <i>stable</i>.  It is usually
      recommended to download and install a <i>latest</i> package to have the
      latest features and functionality.

    <h3>MPI Support for LAMMPS on Windows</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      To use the MPI based parallelism in the provided installer packages, you also need to install
      Microsoft MPI (MS-MPI) that can be downloaded from
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=100593" target="_blank">the Microsoft home page</a>.
      You only need to download and execute the <t>msmpisetup.exe</t> installer. This contains
      the runtime support. The additional download offered, <t>msmpisdk.msi</t> contains the
      files required to <b>compile</b> LAMMPS with MPI and Visual C++ from source code.
      If you would prefer to compile LAMMPS from source, you can follow the
      <a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Build_windows.html#msvc" target="_blank">instructions
      in the LAMMPS manual</a> for compiling LAMMPS with Visual Studio.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      Older versions of LAMMPS binaries were compiled using a very old MPICH version from Argonne.
      As of the 2 August 20233 version, this is no longer supported.

    <hr width="100%">

    <h2>Running LAMMPS on Windows</h2>
    <h3>General Comments</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      LAMMPS is a text mode program, so you have to click on the
      <i>Command Prompt</i> entry in the windows start menu, launch the
      <i>Windows Power Shell</i>, or simply execute the command
      <strong><code>cmd</code></strong> from <i>Start -&gt; Run</i>.
      The LAMMPS manual and the colvars reference manual in PDF format
      are linked from the start men, also references to open the
      file system browser to view the <i>Benchmarks</i> and <i>Examples</i>
      directory tree. The <b>PATH</b> environment variable is automatically
      set by the installer, so that the bundled executables from everywhere
      in the system. Also the <b>LAMMPS_POTENTIALS</b> environment variable
      is preset to the folder with the bundled manybody potential files,
      so they do not need to be copied into the respective working directory.
    </p>

    <p align="justify")
       As of LAMMPS version 2 August 2023, we also offer a LAMMPS GUI, which
       is just a notepad like text editor with the LAMMPS library included.
       Thus it can run the edited file directly without using a console.
       This is primarily intended as a convenience to beginners.</p>

    <h3>Serial Execution</h3>
    <div style="display: inline; margin-left: 10px; border: 5px; border-style: groove; float: right;">
      <a imageanchor="1" href="lammps-icms-on-win7.png" style=""><img src="lammps-icms-on-win7.png" border="0" style="" width="400" height="300"></a>
    </div>
    <p align="justify">
      To run a LAMMPS simulations please open a console window as outlined above
      and change to the directory with your input script and then run
      <strong><code>lmp</code></strong> as described in the LAMMPS
      manual. For more details and additional command line flags, please
      check out the
      <a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Run_basics.html" target="_blank">
        LAMMPS Manual</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 name="openmp">Multi-threaded Parallel Execution</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      All LAMMPS binaries from this repository support multi-threading via OpenMP,
      however by default only one thread is enabled. To enable more threads, e.g. four,
      you need to either set it at the command line prompt via
      <strong><code>set OMP_NUM_THREADS=4</code></strong>, via the
      <strong><code>-pk&nbsp;omp&nbsp;4</code></strong> command line flag, or via the
      <a href="https://docs.lammps.org/package.html" target="_blank">package omp 4</a>
      command in your input script.</p>

    <p align="justify">
      After enabling the use of multiple threads, you <b>also</b> have to select
      styles in LAMMPS, that are multi-thread enabled. Those are usually identified
      by the <i>/omp</i> suffix. Those can be selected explicitly and selectively,
      or with the
      <a href="https://docs.lammps.org/package.html" target="_blank">suffix</a>
      command or - most conveniently - via using the <strong><code>-sf&nbsp;omp</code></strong>
      command line flag to the LAMMPS executable.
    </p>
    Example: <strong><code>lmp -pk omp 4 -sf omp -in in.melt</code></strong>

    <h3 name="mpi">Message Passing (MPI) Parallel Execution</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      Only the executable from the LAMMPS-MPI packages supports parallel execution
      via MPI (which can be combined with OpenMP multi-threading). For that you also
      need to install MS-MPI from Microsoft linked above.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      MPI parallel executables have to be launched
      with <strong><code>mpiexec -n # lmp ...</code></strong>
      or <strong><code>mpiexec -np # lmp ...</code></strong> with "#"
      being then number of parallel processes to start.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      <u><i>Known Issues:</i></u> while running in MPI parallel mode any
      output to the screen is block buffered and not line buffered as
      usual. That is, output will not show up immediately, but only
      after a certain amount of output has accumulated. This is done for
      efficiency reasons.  Multi-threaded parallel or serial runs are
      not affected.  Also when running under mpiexec, you should not use
      multi-threading, since MPICH restricts processes to a single
      physical CPU thus it will run less efficient. </p>
